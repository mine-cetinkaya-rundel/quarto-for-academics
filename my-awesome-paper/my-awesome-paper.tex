\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Note that figures and tables (such as Figure~\ref{fig-first} and
  Table~\ref{tbl-one}) should appear in the paper, not at the end or in
  separate files.
\item
  In document front matter, you may set the key \texttt{blinded} under a
  \texttt{journal} key to hide the authors and acknowledgements,
  producing the required anonymized version.
\item
  Remember that in the anonymized version, you should not identify
  authors indirectly in the text. That is, don't say ``In Smith et.
  al.~(2009) we showed that \ldots{}''. Instead, say ``Smith et.
  al.~(2009) showed that \ldots{}''.
\item
  These points are only intended to remind you of some requirements.
  Please refer to the instructions for authors at

\item
  If you have supplementary material (e.g., software, data, technical
  proofs), identify them in the section below. In early stages of the
  submission process, you may be unsure what to include as supplementary
  material. Don't worry---this is something that can be worked out at
  later stages.

\citet{gelm:veht:2021} offer some guidance about key ideas about
statistical ideas. On an unrelated note, spreadsheets are important to
use correctly \citep{brom:woo:2018}. Log-linear models are an attractive
way to model categorical data \citep{bish:fien:1975}.
