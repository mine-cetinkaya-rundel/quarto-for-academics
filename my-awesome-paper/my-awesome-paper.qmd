## Introduction {#sec-intro}

Body of paper.
Margins in this document are roughly 0.75 inches all around, letter size paper.[@çetinkaya-rundel2021]

![Consistency comparison in fitting surrogate model in the tidal power example.](fig1.pdf){#fig-first width="3in"}

| one  | two  | three | four | five |
|------|------|-------|------|------|
| 1.23 | 3.45 | 5.00  | 1.21 | 3.41 |
| 1.23 | 3.45 | 5.00  | 1.21 | 3.42 |

: D-optimality values for design X under five different scenarios. {#tbl-one}

-   Note that figures and tables (such as @fig-first and @tbl-one) should appear in the paper, not at the end or in separate files.
-   In document front matter, you may set the key `blinded` under a `journal` key to hide the authors and acknowledgements, producing the required anonymized version.
-   Remember that in the anonymized version, you should not identify authors indirectly in the text. That is, don't say "In Smith et. al. (2009) we showed that ...". Instead, say "Smith et. al. (2009) showed that ...".
-   These points are only intended to remind you of some requirements. Please refer to the instructions for authors at <http://amstat.tandfonline.com/action/authorSubmission?journalCode=uasa20&page=instructions#.VFkk7fnF_0c>
-   For more about ASA style, please see <https://files.taylorandfrancis.com/asa-style-guide.pdf>.
-   If you have supplementary material (e.g., software, data, technical proofs), identify them in the section below. In early stages of the submission process, you may be unsure what to include as supplementary material. Don't worry---this is something that can be worked out at later stages.

## Methods {#sec-meth}

Don't take any of these section titles seriously.
They're just for illustration.[@wickham2019]

## Verifications {#sec-verify}

This section will be just long enough to illustrate what a full page of text looks like, for margins and spacing.

@gelm:veht:2021 offer some guidance about key ideas about statistical ideas.
On an unrelated note, spreadsheets are important to use correctly [@brom:woo:2018].
Log-linear models are an attractive way to model categorical data [@bish:fien:1975].
